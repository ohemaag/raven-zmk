# Raven - 42 key split ergonomic keyboard 
## **IMPORTANT PLEASE READ ALL**
This is my second keyboard project, the Raven (or Raven 42) named after the bird for its wing-like design and deep purple color, much like my original prototype. 

Raven has a pcb but can easily be handwired if you desire. The case and plate have been designed to be easily 3d printed. This keyboard does not utilize standoffs or screws, but is desinged to simply sit in the case, using rubber bumpers to prevent the pcb from moving while typing in or out of the case.

### Parts Needed
- 42 MX style switches
- 42 1N4148 diodes
- 42 1u keycaps
- 2 nice!nano v2 or suitable clone
- 2 110 mAh 3.7v lithium ion battery
- 8mm x 2mm rubber bumper (for case feet / pcb)
- 11mm x 5 mm rubber bumper (for case feet)

### 3D Printing 
When 3D printing the case and plate, I would recommend 100% infill or as close to 100% as possible to ensure the best acoustics. Lower infill = a more hollow sound.

### Optional Case Silicon Pour

### PCB Files
In the pcb files folder, you can either choose a hotswap or soldered pcb gerber file to have manufactured at somewhere like JCLPCB or PCBWay. Just keep in mind that the version wtih hotswap sockets will cost more to manufacture, and you will still need to solder on the microcontroller\diodes.
